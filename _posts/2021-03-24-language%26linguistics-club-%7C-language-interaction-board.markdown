  <div class="p-description description"><p>This is a small-size pop up event. One Language Merge Space and one Q&A space will be set up for the purpose of interacting with students. We will present lots of trendy words (i.e., 2021 graduation, zoom, 干饭人... etc) in advance on the whiteboard where students can translate those words to any language they like, or interpret in the way related to how they understand them. Students can also interact with each other in the Q&A space where we are going to put forward some interesting questions (i.e., how was your trip from your hometown to NYUSH during the outbreak of the pandemic?). But of course, students can write their own questions and expect them to be answered by others as well. Through this event, we hope to promote the language diversity in NYUSH, enhance the bonds/connections within the community as well as help students to relieve the stress for the already coming midterm in a light atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
