Want to learn about Spring 2021 language courses, minor in Chinese/other languages, placements, Intro to Linguistics, our faculty, and general language and linguistics resources on campus? Follow our multilingual playlist and stop by at our booth during lunchtime to learn about the Department of World Languages and our Language & Linguistics Club!

In preparation for the upcoming registration week, World Languages and Langua_Lingua are cohosting the info booth and an info session in the week of Nov 30. You are welcome to ask all kinds of language-related questions and get to know our language faculty in person. Currently remote? No worries, we will upload all posters and illustrations to our album and you are always welcome to reach out to us with questions!

At the info booth, we will play our multilingual playlist. You are encouraged to dance to the music while passing by and join the mic! Wanna contribute your favorite songs? Add to our [Spotify list](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/08HH4Nog7PduQofrXe0mLi?si=B_0K6saUTJaCNTXsZUU8Cw)!

We also look forward to learning your languages and dialects to construct a language diversity profile of our community! Join our interviews at the booth and the following Instagram campaign!
