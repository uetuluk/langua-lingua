  <div class="p-description description"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will talk about language identity to kick off this semester's language mixer series. We have added something new to this traditional event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come and share your language! Do you know any fun facts about one of the languages you speak? Are there words or phrases that are hard to translate or explain? How does speaking this language make you who you are?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come and connect with other people who share this language, or find people who speak the language you want to learn. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to talk with native speakers of the language you want to learn.</span></p></div>
