Our Mission:

Celebrate the language and cultural diversity at NYU Shanghai by inspiring conversations and sharing opportunities in language exchange and the study of linguistics.

We provide:

Language exchange programs through interest-based language partner pairing, language-themed group sessions, and community gathering for bonding and celebrating.

Linguistics workshops and discussion panels to explore topics such as phonetics & phonology, morphology & syntax, semantics & pragmatics, acquisition, as well as neuro-, computational, historical, socio- linguistics; which we will associate with the context of language learning and multidisciplinary endeavours at NYU Shanghai. 

A regularly updated resource pool for language learning and opportunities in linguistics, to be featured on our website along with our board member profiles, events, and interactive archives.

Meanwhile, we look forward to hearing from you: What is your passion and interest? What ideas do you have? What initiative of yours can we support? What would you like to see us become?

We aim to raise awareness of the language and cultural diversity at NYUSH. We aim to enhance the community feel and inter-class year connections in the student body with inclusive and fun topics around languages. Meanwhile, with established connections with World Languages, Chinese Department, Diversity Initiative, Study Away Program, Department of Linguistics (in NY), and several student organizations across the NYU network, we aim to bond students with language and linguistics faculty, university offices, as well as opportunities in and beyond our community.

WE AIM TO INSPIRE AND LET INSPIRE.
